# Frontend Route Parity Map

Last reviewed: 2026-07-14

Status: **Maintained reference — current policy with historical route snapshots**

Evidence provenance: the current policy was reviewed on 2026-07-14 against
Laravel `903d03d3db78bbf87129ad35728be3b72819acaf` and repository commit
`9c5fb1a46c40e4986c8f973075164b1d74bd101d`. The legacy tables below did not
record both input SHAs and are therefore historical and provenance-incomplete;
they cannot support a current parity percentage. Use the generated Web UK
artifacts only when their own metadata names the exact source commits and dirty
state.

Laravel source of truth:

- `C:\platforms\htdocs\staging\react-frontend`
- `C:\platforms\htdocs\staging\accessible-frontend`
- `C:\platforms\htdocs\staging\routes\govuk-alpha.php`
- `C:\platforms\htdocs\staging\routes\govuk-alpha-parity`

Repository surfaces:

- `apps/react-frontend` is now legacy/frozen and kept as historical reference.
- `apps/web-uk` is the implementation target for the future shared accessible
  frontend. Its location in this repository does not make ASP.NET authoritative
  for its behaviour.
- `apps/admin` remains secondary unless a task explicitly targets it.

Canonical React frontend target:

- `C:\platforms\htdocs\staging\react-frontend`

The forward path is not to continue developing the ASP.NET React copy. The
forward path is to make the ASP.NET backend contract-compatible with the
production Laravel React frontend. Do not modify frontend files unless the user
explicitly approves that specific frontend change.

## Two-Frontends-By-Two-Backends Target

| Frontend | Laravel backend | ASP.NET backend |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Canonical React | Production source-of-truth baseline | Same unchanged frontend, contract-correct and runtime-certified |
| Shared accessible Web UK | Laravel-first implementation and certification target | Same unchanged Web UK code, switched by configuration only after backend certification |

Route declaration equality alone proves none of these four runtime combinations.
Current workstream status lives in `CURRENT_ASPNET_CONTRACT_STATUS.md` and
`../apps/web-uk/docs/CURRENT_LARAVEL_FIRST_PARITY_STATUS.md`.

## Historical Static Route Counts

Generated with `scripts/compare-laravel-frontend-parity.ps1` on 2026-07-04.
These historical accessible counts are superseded for current Web UK work by
`apps/web-uk/docs/generated/accessible-route-matrix.*`.

| Surface | Laravel source routes | .NET target routes | Matched | Missing from .NET | Extra in .NET |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| React SPA/admin | 589 | 462 | 393 | 196 | 69 |
| Accessible HTML | 607 | 136 | 53 | 554 | 83 |

These counts are not a frontend parity score. The comparison is a static route
inventory using React Router `<Route path="...">`, Laravel GOV.UK route files,
and Express `app/router` declarations. It does not prove rendered UI parity,
feature-gate parity, API wiring, localization, accessibility quality, or workflow
completion.

The historical script compares Laravel React routes against the legacy
`apps/react-frontend` copy and accessible routes against `apps/web-uk`. Those
React counts are now historical inventory only. They do not define the forward
development target and must not be used to justify new work in the legacy React
copy.

Future compatibility reports should instead inventory API calls made by
`C:\platforms\htdocs\staging\react-frontend`, then verify that ASP.NET exposes
compatible routes, request shapes, response shapes, auth/tenant behavior,
uploads, realtime config, and status codes.

The `608/612` Web UK matrix recorded after merge commit `f7c80d32` on
2026-07-08 is also historical. For the current matrix and its exact source SHAs,
read `apps/web-uk/docs/CURRENT_LARAVEL_FIRST_PARITY_STATUS.md` and regenerate
`apps/web-uk/docs/generated/accessible-route-matrix.*`. A current static matrix
still does not prove rendered UI, workflow, tenant/auth, localization, API side
effects, or Laravel/ASP.NET runtime behavior.

## Accessible Frontend Direction And Authority

Laravel Blade is the product/UI source of truth for browser routes, links,
layout, navigation, content hierarchy, forms, validation presentation,
redirects, tenant behaviour, and workflows:

```text
C:\platforms\htdocs\staging\accessible-frontend
C:\platforms\htdocs\staging\routes\govuk-alpha.php
C:\platforms\htdocs\staging\routes\govuk-alpha-parity
```

The Laravel backend/API is separately authoritative for HTTP methods and paths,
payloads, response envelopes, status codes, auth, roles, modules, uploads,
downloads, persistence, and side effects.

`apps/web-uk` keeps Express/Nunjucks/GOV.UK Frontend and is being completed as
the future shared accessible frontend. ASP.NET is an incomplete future second
backend, not a frontend source of truth. It must be made contract-compatible by
the separate backend workstream; Web UK must not acquire backend-specific page
or workflow branches. Current implementation does not itself prove production
readiness. The React utility-bar accessible link must continue
pointing at the production Laravel accessible frontend until `apps/web-uk` has
passed route, workflow, tenant-domain, auth, localization, accessibility, and
runtime smoke certification.

The Laravel repository, schema, and ordinary local database are read-only from
the Web UK workstream. Mutation, upload, download, and destructive certification
require a separately provisioned, verified disposable Laravel environment. The
ordinary production-derived local database is never a test fixture;
no cleanup plan creates an exception. Web UK work must not modify ASP.NET
backend source, tests, migrations, schema, fixtures, or runtime data.

## Generated Artifacts

The repeatable static comparison script writes these ignored artifacts by
default:

```text
artifacts/parity/frontend/frontend-parity.json
artifacts/parity/frontend/frontend-parity.csv
artifacts/parity/frontend/frontend-parity.md
```

Run the fixture test before relying on a regenerated report:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\test-compare-laravel-frontend-parity.ps1
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\compare-laravel-frontend-parity.ps1
```

## High-Risk Missing React Families

This section is historical. It shows what the old ASP.NET React fork was missing
at the time of the route scan. Do not implement these gaps in
`apps/react-frontend/` unless explicitly approved. Prefer implementing the
ASP.NET backend endpoints required by the canonical Laravel React frontend.

| Route family | Missing routes | Parity implication |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `admin/*` | 63 | Admin modules still have major route gaps, especially caring, marketplace, national KISS, and operations. |
| `super-admin/*` | 25 | Platform-level administration remains incomplete. |
| `caring-community/*` | 24 | Member-facing Caring Community route set is mostly absent in .NET React. |
| `broker/*` | 9 | Broker/admin route ownership needs reconciliation. |
| `courses/*` | 9 | Course frontend remains a module gap. |
| `podcasts/*` | 4 | Podcast frontend remains a module gap. |

## Historical High-Risk Missing Accessible Families

This table is retained only as the first static scan's history. It is not the
current Web UK queue; use the Laravel-first status document.

| Route family | Missing routes | Parity implication |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `volunteering/*` | 52 | `apps/web-uk` lacks most Laravel accessible volunteering workflows. |
| `marketplace/*` | 48 | Accessible marketplace workflow coverage is mostly missing. |
| `jobs/*` | 38 | Accessible jobs workflow coverage is incomplete. |
| `ideation/*` | 34 | Accessible ideation workflow coverage is incomplete. |
| `federation/*` | 28 | Federation accessible/admin-adjacent routes need mapping. |
| `goals/*` | 27 | Goals accessible workflow coverage is incomplete. |
| `groups/*` | 27 | Group accessible workflow coverage is incomplete. |
| `courses/*` | 26 | Accessible course workflows are absent from .NET. |
| `feed/*` | 21 | Accessible feed workflows are substantially incomplete. |
| `profile/*` | 20 | Profile/account accessible routes need parity work. |

## Acceptance Criteria For Frontend Parity

- The production Laravel React frontend at
  `C:\platforms\htdocs\staging\react-frontend` can run against ASP.NET for the
  certified module without request/response contract failures.
- Every Laravel React API call used by the certified module has a matching
  ASP.NET method/path, including `/api/v2` aliases where expected.
- Request bodies, query parameters, response envelopes, pagination, validation
  errors, auth/tenant errors, upload behavior, realtime config, and status codes
  are compatible with Laravel.
- Every Laravel accessible route under `govuk-alpha*` has an equivalent
  `apps/web-uk` route, view, form method, validation behavior, and API support.
- Admin, super-admin, partner, broker, and accessible surfaces are tracked
  independently.
- Compatibility is proven with a route/API matrix, ASP.NET regression tests, and
  runtime smoke tests using the Laravel React frontend against the ASP.NET API.
- The same unchanged, Laravel-certified Web UK frontend passes equivalent
  runtime workflows against ASP.NET by changing backend configuration only.
