# Project NEXUS System Documentation

Last reviewed: 2026-07-15

Status: **Maintained system reference - product status remains separate**

This hub is the entry point for developers, integrators, testers, and operators
working on the experimental Project NEXUS .NET edition. It indexes current
instructions instead of duplicating fast-changing scores or generated counts.

## System Shape

The required end state is two unchanged clients by two backends:

| Client | Laravel | ASP.NET |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Canonical React in the Laravel repository | Production contract source | Experimental contract-correct twin target |
| Shared accessible Web UK in this repository | Laravel-first source and verification target | Future configuration-only switching target |

Laravel defines behavior. Route presence, a generated matrix, a build, or a
focused test is not semantic or production certification.

## System Guides

| Guide | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| [Local development](LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md) | Supported local API stack, ports, startup effects, and troubleshooting boundaries. |
| [Configuration](CONFIGURATION.md) | Configuration precedence, core keys, secret handling, and edition-specific settings. |
| [Testing and evidence](TESTING.md) | Test layers, disposable databases, Web UK safety, sharding, CI, and certification meaning. |
| [Security and tenancy](SECURITY_AND_TENANCY.md) | Authentication, tenant isolation, authorization, CORS/WebAuthn, rate limiting, and known gaps. |
| [Operations](OPERATIONS.md) | Production authority, deployed surfaces, known unsafe/legacy automation, migrations, backup, and rollback boundaries. |
| [Incident response](INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md) | Read-only alert triage, authorization boundary, restart/migration warning, and closure evidence. |
| [API consumer guide](../api/README.md) | Versioning, authentication, tenancy, envelopes, errors, pagination, uploads, and contract authority. |

## Architecture And Data

- [Canonical architecture](../ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Module map](../MODULES.md)
- [Migration workflow](../database-migrations.md)
- [Schema parity](../SCHEMA_PARITY.md)
- [Registration policy engine](../REGISTRATION_POLICY_ENGINE.md)
- [Backend localization contract](../BACKEND_LOCALIZATION_CONTRACT.md)

## Current Status And Evidence

- [ASP.NET contract status](../CURRENT_ASPNET_CONTRACT_STATUS.md) is the only
  current backend score authority.
- [Web UK status](../../apps/web-uk/docs/CURRENT_LARAVEL_FIRST_PARITY_STATUS.md)
  is the only accessible-frontend certification score authority.
- [Parity remediation runbook](../FULL_PARITY_REMEDIATION_RUNBOOK.md) owns the
  fixed rubric and cross-workstream end state.
- [Documentation health](../DOCUMENTATION_HEALTH_REPORT.md) scores documentation
  only and must never be quoted as product completion.

## Mandatory Boundaries

- Read `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` before changing the repository.
- Treat `C:\platforms\htdocs\staging` and its ordinary production-derived
  database as read-only.
- Do not modify the frozen `apps/react-frontend` client without explicit user
  approval.
- Before any production action, obtain explicit authorization and read
  `.claude/production-containers.md` immediately beforehand.
- Preserve unrelated dirty work and use separate worktrees for shared schema
  hotspots.
