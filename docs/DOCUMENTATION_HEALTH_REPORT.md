# Documentation Health And Pause-Readiness Report

Last verified: 2026-07-15

Status: **Generated snapshot — documentation and handoff quality only, not product readiness**

<!-- doc-consistency: DOCUMENTATION_HEALTH_BASELINE=D3 -->
<!-- doc-consistency: DOCUMENTATION_HEALTH_SCORE=1000/1000 -->

## Audit Correction And Scope

Earlier documentation audits measured narrower questions:

- **Baseline D1** measured internal parity-document consistency and claimed
  100/100, but omitted important user, administrator, API, configuration,
  security, and operational coverage. That claim was corrected.
- **Baseline U1** scored user/administrator documentation 32/100 before its
  audience-hub remediation.
- **Baseline S1** scored system/operator documentation 44/100 before command,
  configuration, deployment, incident, backup, and restore remediation.
- **Baseline D2** scored the remediated system-wide documentation 100/100 at its
  named boundary. It did not test whether a repository could be abandoned for
  weeks and safely resumed from one clean, frozen Git state.

Baseline D3 adds that pause/resume requirement and uses the user-requested
1,000-point denominator. D3 supersedes D2 as the current documentation-health
score. It does not rewrite the earlier baselines or turn their denominators into
product progress.

## Baseline D3 — 1000/1000

Documentation Health Baseline D3 scores the paused repository **1000/1000**.
The score applies to the clean commit identified by annotated tag
`pause/2026-07-15`, with Laravel comparison source
`903d03d3db78bbf87129ad35728be3b72819acaf` and ASP.NET product/schema boundary
`c767050a3eabd064bdf647695b9699b98186342b`.

This is **documentation health only**. It means a new agent can discover the
truth, distinguish proved from unproved work, and resume safely after explicit
authorization. It does not mean the ASP.NET backend, schema, Web UK, unchanged-
client switching, CI, providers, or production are complete or certified.

| D3 category | Score | Evidence |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Mission and contract-decision integrity | 120/120 | ADR-0001 makes externally contract-identical behavior binding. Every first-read guide states the two-unchanged-frontends-by-two-backends target, Laravel authority, configuration-only switching, and prohibition on frontend forks. Historical “parity” is explicitly shorthand, never a weaker acceptance standard. |
| Navigation, authority, and cold-start order | 110/110 | Root/docs/Web UK entry points route a new agent through AGENTS, CLAUDE, the pause handoff, ADR, separate ASP.NET/schema/Web UK status pages, then the resume-only runbook. Governance defines one authority for each decision, score, audience, and operational boundary. |
| Exact pause state, provenance, and certification honesty | 140/140 | The pause handoff records named Laravel/ASP.NET/Web UK boundaries, banked versus published-unscored work, dirty generated-artifact provenance, independent product scores, CI timeout semantics, invalidation rules, and what must never be inferred from static counts or focused evidence. |
| Schema readiness and recommission blueprint | 140/140 | The canonical schema page records 165 classes/163 runtime IDs/two quarantines, the migration-163 repair, earlier blank and populated evidence, 129/150 bank, exact diagnostic counts, timed-out exact-SHA CI, seven missing proof gates, safe disposable-database commands, and first tasks for the next phase. |
| Workstream handoffs, prompts, ownership, and finite queues | 130/130 | The pause handoff supplies copy-ready read-only, backend, schema, and Web UK prompts. Canonical status pages preserve the backend eight-package queue and Web UK three-gate finish line. The runbook is fenced as resume-only and exclusive ownership rules protect shared hotspots. |
| Development, testing, security, data, and operations safety | 110/110 | Maintained guides cover supported Docker development, real ports and fictitious seed identities, configuration, test evidence levels, tenant/security invariants, ordinary-Laravel-database prohibition, manual-only production authority, deployment quarantine, incidents, backups/restores, and exact-SHA limitations. Invalid shard documentation was corrected to `-ShardIndex`. |
| Audience, contributor, legal, and governance coverage | 90/90 | Member, administrator, API consumer, developer/operator, support, vulnerability, contributor, and conduct audiences have discoverable entry points. Root and Web UK attribution agree on hOUR Timebank CLG and Sarah Bird. CONTRIBUTING, contributor terms, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, LICENSE, NOTICE, SUPPORT, SECURITY, CHANGELOG, and the ADR index are linked. |
| Git/worktree/stash/branch freeze and history preservation | 80/80 | Five worktrees became one; nine local branches became `main` only; eight old stashes became zero; unique and superseded histories were retained under 17 pushed `archive/pre-pause/*` tags; six stale remote branches were removed; three branches backing open Dependabot PRs were retained; ignored accidental debris was removed. |
| Automated consistency, links, artifact hygiene, and reproducibility | 80/80 | The documentation guard checks D3 arithmetic, pause markers, score/provenance boundaries, safety rules, audience entry points, generated-artifact caveats, and deployment quarantines. The pause-readiness guard also checks Git topology, archive-tag targets, final tag, clean remote equality, debris absence, documentation consistency, and Markdown links. |
| **Total** | **1000/1000** | **Documentation health only. Product and certification gaps remain open.** |

The D3 denominator is fixed. A future contradiction or failed required gate
reduces the affected row until corrected. A new rubric requires a named
baseline and an explicit mapping; it must not silently preserve 1000.

## Iterative Audit Record

The score was not awarded at the start of the task. The audit loop kept the
same D3 denominator and closed explicit deductions:

| D3 pass | Score | What was still deducted |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Initial pause-readiness audit | 620/1000 | No binding contract correction, no single cold-start handoff, incomplete current schema verdict, no copy-ready prompts/pause fence, stale contributor facts, five worktrees, nine local branches, eight stashes, stale remote heads, and ignored debris. |
| Contract-decision pass | 660/1000 | ADR-0001 closed mission ambiguity; schema, cold-start, and Git-freeze deductions remained. |
| Schema-evidence pass | 725/1000 | Canonical schema verdict and recommission package closed the schema-documentation deduction; cold-start and Git freeze remained. |
| Handoff/governance pass | 925/1000 | Pause blueprint, read order, prompts, runbook fence, normal project docs, attribution repair, and stronger contract wording closed every documentation-content deduction. The remaining 75 points were withheld for physical Git cleanup and proof. |
| Repository-freeze pass | **1000/1000** | Archive tags were pushed, stale worktrees/branches/stashes/remotes and debris were removed, unfinished CI work was preserved rather than merged, and the final clean tagged boundary passed the automated guard. |

## Product Boundaries Preserved

- [ASP.NET Fixed Rubric Baseline 1](CURRENT_ASPNET_CONTRACT_STATUS.md) remains
  **712/1000**. The latest banked implementation is `5fa15e0e`; later backend,
  schema, test, and CI work remains published but unscored.
- The [schema category](CURRENT_SCHEMA_READINESS.md) remains **129/150**. The
  chain repair is implemented, but migration-163, complete exact-SHA suite/CI,
  remaining storage classification, and release/production upgrades are not
  certified.
- [Web UK Baseline W1](../apps/web-uk/docs/CURRENT_LARAVEL_FIRST_PARITY_STATUS.md)
  remains **663/1000**. Goal W2 has **no percentage** and three gates: isolated
  manual accessibility evidence/fixes, the accessibility-copy decision, then a
  complete W2 audit/certification transaction.
- Static route/API/schema counts are inventories. None certifies payloads,
  auth, tenancy, side effects, providers, workflows, upgrades, or either
  unchanged-client backend switch.
- The ordinary Laravel database remains a confidential production-derived
  snapshot and is never a test fixture.

## Repository Freeze Evidence

### Preserved Histories

Seventeen annotated tags under `archive/pre-pause/*` preserve:

- two re-audit snapshots;
- three unique Web UK prototype tips;
- the merged schema and Web UK workstream tips;
- the legacy `master` tip;
- eight former stash commits; and
- the unfinished four-way CI sharding/coverage experiment.

The CI experiment was not merged. YAML and PowerShell parsed, but its isolated
local validation spent about 15 minutes in coverage collection and ended
without a TRX or coverage report. The exact patch is recoverable from
`archive/pre-pause/unfinished-ci-sharding`; it requires a new authorized phase
and terminal proof before use.

### Removed And Retained Remote Heads

Removed as stale after tag preservation or merge verification:

- `codex/reaudit-snapshot-20260715-0459`;
- `codex/reaudit-snapshot-20260715-0514`;
- `codex/schema-parity-20260714`;
- `codex/web-uk-laravel-parity`;
- legacy `master`; and
- superseded `dependabot/nuget/src/Nexus.Api/nuget-9b822c48da` (PR 69 closed;
  `main` already carries a newer package version).

Retained because they back open dependency PRs and are therefore not stale
workstream branches:

- Buildx PR 11;
- frozen-React `qs` PR 71; and
- standalone-admin `qs` PR 72.

The GitHub connector was used to distinguish live PR heads from stale remote
branches rather than deleting all non-`main` refs indiscriminately.

## Required Verification

Run from the repository root after fetching the published tags and refs:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/check-pause-readiness.ps1
npm --prefix apps/web-uk test -- --runInBand tests/contributors.test.js
git status --short --branch
git rev-parse HEAD
git rev-parse origin/main
git show pause/2026-07-15 --no-patch
```

The pause-readiness script includes the documentation consistency and Markdown
link checks. It must report one clean `main` worktree, no local topic branch or
stash, `HEAD=origin/main`, only the three intentional open-PR remote heads,
exact archive-tag targets, the final pause tag at `HEAD`, and no known ignored
debris.

The contributor test passed 15/15 after root/Web UK attribution reconciliation.
No production system, production container, Laravel database, production-
derived data, or deployment was used by this documentation and repository-
freeze audit.

## Invalidation Rule

Do not retain 1000/1000 if any required check fails or a new audit finds an
unresolved contradiction. Product development, new refs, changed source SHAs,
new generated evidence, a modified canonical score, or a resumed workstream
invalidates the clean pause snapshot and requires a new dated audit record.
