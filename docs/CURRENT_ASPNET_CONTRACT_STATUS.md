# Current ASP.NET Contract Status

Last verified: 2026-07-15 22:39 +01:00

Status: **Canonical current - ASP.NET score and certification source**

<!-- doc-consistency: ASPNET_CURRENT_BANKED_SCORE=712/1000 -->

Use this document for the current ASP.NET completion score. Use
[`FULL_PARITY_REMEDIATION_RUNBOOK.md`](FULL_PARITY_REMEDIATION_RUNBOOK.md) for
the fixed rubric, shared evidence gates, and execution loop. The finite ordered
backend queue lives in this document. Historical
scores elsewhere are checkpoints only and do not override this page.

For the current schema-chain verdict and cold-start sequence, read
[`CURRENT_SCHEMA_READINESS.md`](CURRENT_SCHEMA_READINESS.md). It does not create
a separate backend score.

The matching accessible-frontend source is
[`CURRENT_LARAVEL_FIRST_PARITY_STATUS.md`](../apps/web-uk/docs/CURRENT_LARAVEL_FIRST_PARITY_STATUS.md).
Do not combine its score with the ASP.NET score: the two workstreams have
different evidence gates.

## Required End State

The product goal is a **two-frontends-by-two-backends** contract-identity model in
which neither frontend changes behavior when its backend changes:

[`ADR-0001`](decisions/ADR-0001-contract-identical-backends.md) is binding:
"compatibility" in this filename or rubric means externally contract-identical
behavior for every consumed boundary, not an approximately similar API.

| Unchanged client | Laravel backend | ASP.NET backend |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Canonical React at `C:\platforms\htdocs\staging\react-frontend` | Production source-of-truth behavior | Same methods, paths, payloads, responses, statuses, auth, tenancy, uploads, side effects, and workflows |
| Accessible Web UK at `apps/web-uk` | Laravel-first certification target | The same Web UK code and page flows, switched by configuration only |

Route presence alone is not contract correctness. ASP.NET must reproduce the
Laravel contracts consumed by both unchanged clients, including validation and
error envelopes, redirects, authorization boundaries, tenant behavior,
provider effects, persistence, and upgrade behavior. Frontend adapters or
ASP.NET-specific page branches do not satisfy the goal.

## Current Scored Position

The **current banked score is 712/1000 (71.2%)** under Fixed Rubric Baseline 1.
The denominator is fixed; newly discovered work is recorded as a deduction or
a separately named Laravel-drift baseline, never as a silent denominator
change.

The 2026-07-15 system-wide re-audit keeps this score unchanged. Eleven backend
implementation/test commits were published to `origin/main` after the restart
scorecard. A later user-authorized transaction committed two test expectation
corrections and merged nine verified schema slices. The separately authorized
post-pause CI remediation has now produced a complete green exact-SHA aggregate
at `dbafc5c3`, but none of these changes has received a fixed-rubric scoring
transaction. All are recorded below instead of being converted into an
estimated percentage.

| Category | Banked | Maximum | Open |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Active Laravel API route representation | 100 | 100 | 0 |
| Semantic workflow and canonical-consumer contract parity | 307 | 350 | 43 |
| Schema, migrations, data integrity, and upgrade safety | 129 | 150 | 21 |
| Auth, tenant isolation, security, and localization | 97 | 100 | 3 |
| Full build/test/CI evidence | 45 | 100 | 55 |
| Unchanged canonical React plus unchanged Web UK dual-backend runtime proof | 10 | 125 | 115 |
| Providers, jobs, integrations, operational proof, and reproducible docs | 24 | 75 | 51 |
| **Total** | **712** | **1000** | **288** |

Active route representation is **2,601/2,601 matched with 0 missing**. Seven
retired OpenAPI-only operations are reported separately and return to the
active gate automatically if a live Laravel route reintroduces them. This
closes the representation inventory only; it is not runtime, semantic, or
production certification. The separately generated canonical React matrix has
2,328 static call-site rows and 2,016 unique method/path entries, with 0 ASP.NET
static gaps and 171 method-unresolved entries. The reconciled inventory does not
prove payload, status, auth, tenant, side-effect, or runtime correctness; those
rows remain semantic and unchanged-client work rather than route-score evidence.

## Baseline And Banked Evidence

Fixed Rubric Baseline 1 froze:

- Laravel `903d03d3db78bbf87129ad35728be3b72819acaf`;
- ASP.NET `b751d22f38baf0ac8bdf90fe669550b568fcb489`;
- the evidence snapshot at 2026-07-14 10:51:18 +01;
- an initial banked score of **620/1000**.

Subsequent points were banked only after their implementation and evidence were
published:

| Published checkpoint | Evidence | Banked movement |
| --- | --- | ---: |

| Marketplace escrow settlement and delayed Connect payout | Implementation `93417bd17e886e8d05e054ec2f679a4851c6ae26` | +8 semantic, +4 schema, +2 providers/operations = **659/1000** |

| Paid-transfer charge-dispute recovery | Implementation `9875fb5dd33e3ab5c33ea77a83fcfb0b8c6c0b00` | +3 semantic, +1 providers/operations = **680/1000** |
| Marketplace refund notification evidence | Implementation `b37a3cc5ed903394b67813a3e34304213b9e150d` | +3 semantic, +1 providers/operations = **684/1000** |
| Secure SSO/OIDC authentication flow | Implementation `c20d064e6adb99d3a585efd299650d5e913180ff` | +8 semantic, +3 schema, +3 security = **698/1000** |
| Tenant-bootstrap precedence and fail-closed runtime proof | Implementation `5fbcf36dedf320c0ca81ac77f8b4771d891f7331`; stable disposable-PostgreSQL verification at ASP.NET `ccd109fc4dc67b0b117780b2130d519e6bb38eea` | +2 semantic, +1 security = **701/1000** |
| Social comment mentions, usernames, and recipient side effects | Implementation `1ff6447012c89744e94d6693463a8032361c5946` | +4 semantic, +2 schema, +1 security/localization = **708/1000** |

| Migrated-schema integration certification harness | Implementation/evidence `fefbb5ce03b83c95cd78fb338b7a5c41da9b6745` | **+0**; corrects the evidence boundary but does not substitute for a complete green suite or CI |

These named values form an audit trail. They are not competing current scores.

## Repository State At This Verification

The latest banked backend implementation inspected for this page is
`5fa15e0e79993464622b1c3ef053fcdd01679991`, with Laravel frozen at
`903d03d3db78bbf87129ad35728be3b72819acaf`. The latest published backend
product/API/schema implementation boundary remains
`c767050a3eabd064bdf647695b9699b98186342b`. It follows schema merge
`df8c8b96c80804785e9c84f9f7c75337088d6024` and adds the missing runtime
creation migration for `compatibility_audit_entries` plus contract and test
corrections. Required-CI workflow commit `b3f946b3fd3de51fa444008a7daee80d3de1bcd2`
and test/evidence commit `dbafc5c329c55a15b4329ff90804d725dbf8b089`
are later published, unscored evidence boundaries; neither changes the product
implementation or banked points.

### Published But Not Rescored

Published commit `fefbb5ce03b83c95cd78fb338b7a5c41da9b6745`
changes the shared integration fixture from `EnsureCreated` to the complete EF
migration chain, so PostgreSQL functions, triggers, preflights, and other raw
migration SQL are present in test databases. It also corrects stale ordinary-
admin expectations for the database-backed platform-super-admin bulk policy and
updates the obsolete volunteer-hours alias case to assert the current Laravel-
shaped validation order. At the frozen Laravel SHA and ASP.NET implementation
SHA, the Release test assembly built with 0 warnings and 0 errors, the focused
fresh-migrated PostgreSQL set passed 14/14, and the five affected classes passed
57/57 in 303.8 seconds. This adds **zero banked points** because the complete
3,331-test suite and exact-SHA CI remain open.

Published commit `923db629dea331ee093018887c4533d2c4e7133e` added the
exact-SHA canonical React call-site generator. Published correction
`bab02a77c3075e182f039785ef097ac88a62f4b9` reconciles constant-root ASP.NET
routes, multiple verb attributes, parameterized route templates, and typed
dynamic frontend actions in the maintained matrix at
[`generated/canonical-react-contracts/README.md`](generated/canonical-react-contracts/README.md).
It records 2,328 call-site rows, 2,016 unique method/path entries, 1,845 with
method evidence, 171 with unresolved methods, and 0 ASP.NET static gaps against
Laravel `903d03d3db78bbf87129ad35728be3b72819acaf` and ASP.NET
`0c8885355154e5d188244e4820977c7f3a6f5e65`. It adds **zero banked points**:
inventory generation does not prove payload, envelope, auth, tenant, side-effect,
or runtime correctness.

The following backend commits after restart scorecard `ea352690` are published
but remain unscored:

| Commit | Published change | Why no points are banked |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `60715dfd` | Deterministic backend shard harness/test setup | Partial moving-SHA shard evidence is not a complete aggregate. |
| `e49c8ca9`, `0b79e2a6` | Regional-analytics and premium-cancel contract-test corrections | Test expectations/probes alone do not close a scored semantic gate. |
| `1fd7a6c0` | Real super-admin tenant move and event-archive contract behavior | Requires fixed-rubric review plus complete certification evidence. |
| `47458d51`, `06e6045e` | Group/campaign expectations and scheduled-job test setup | Evidence/setup corrections are not a complete suite or CI result. |
| `2a1acefe` | Real administrator listing-deletion parity and shard slicing | Requires semantic scoring and exact-SHA aggregate evidence. |
| `59296ac6`, `c370bcb9` | Marketplace/provisioning authorization-test corrections | Corrected expectations do not independently earn points. |
| `738f47e6` | Removal of a noncanonical guest-attendance alias | Needs route/consumer reconciliation and the normal score transaction. |
| `9ad163c9` | Administrator user-role expectation correction | Test-only correction; no scored implementation gate closed. |

All eleven contribute **zero banked points** at this snapshot.

### Published But Still Unscored

- `56dc3b3a` commits the two `/api/users/me` envelope-expectation corrections.
  Shard 17 slice 1 had passed 38/38 with those file contents before commit, but
  a later two-class focused rerun was inconclusive: Debug was file-locked and
  Release exceeded its 15-minute wrapper. It adds zero points.
- `df8c8b96` merges the nine schema commits through `97b8a4a0` into published
  `main`. The resulting exact-SHA static inventory is 458 Laravel tables, 440
  ASP.NET tables, 242 exact names, 216 Laravel-only names, and 198 ASP.NET-only
  names; that branch contained 164 migration source files and 162 runtime IDs.
  Per-slice builds, focused 3/3 tests, model-drift checks, blank replays,
  populated upgrades, and constraint/isolation checks are recorded in
  [`SCHEMA_PARITY.md`](SCHEMA_PARITY.md). The post-merge complete suite/CI
  aggregate is absent, and no scoring transaction has
  accepted a category movement, so it adds zero points.
- `c767050a` advances the current tree to 165 migration classes and 163 runtime
  IDs by adding `20260715184200_AddCompatibilityAuditEntriesTable`. The model
  and snapshot already represented that table; the migration repairs the fresh
  runtime chain. Exact-SHA CI run
  [29441392036](https://github.com/jasperfordesq-ai/api.project-nexus.net/actions/runs/29441392036)
  passed Build, but its migrated Test job was cancelled at the 75-minute limit
  without a terminal summary; coverage merge failed and Docker publish was
  skipped. It adds zero points. The precise schema verdict and recommission
  package are in [`CURRENT_SCHEMA_READINESS.md`](CURRENT_SCHEMA_READINESS.md).
- `b3f946b3` installs the required no-coverage, four-shard workflow after the
  user explicitly resumed a bounded commit/push/fix-until-green CI phase.
  Deterministic allocation covers 3,361 logical tests exactly once as
  841 + 840 + 840 + 840. This workflow evidence adds zero points without a
  fixed-rubric scoring transaction.
- `dbafc5c3` gives each wallet-concurrency request a distinct explicit
  idempotency key so the test exercises five independent transfer attempts
  rather than valid replay of one request. Exact-SHA GitHub Actions run
  [29451087913](https://github.com/jasperfordesq-ai/api.project-nexus.net/actions/runs/29451087913)
  finished terminal green: Build, frozen-React Frontend, all four test shards,
  and Docker Build & Push succeeded. Downloaded TRX artifacts contained 3,385
  runtime rows (841 + 840 + 840 + 864), all passed with 0 failed, skipped,
  error, timeout, or aborted. The 24-row difference from logical allocation is
  shard-4 parameterized-row expansion. Coverage intentionally remains outside
  this required gate. This complete exact-SHA aggregate is published but still
  adds zero banked points pending the required scoring transaction.

### Dirty And In Flight

Immediately before this documentation transaction, `HEAD` and `origin/main`
matched at `dbafc5c3` and the active worktree was clean. The published Web UK
public-copy/test changes and repository operational guardrails are separately
disclosed and remain unscored. The original shard harness remains committed at
`60715dfd`; `b3f946b3` is its required-CI workflow boundary. This documentation
transaction itself, and any dirty, isolated, or projected work, contributes
zero banked points.

### 2026-07-15 Windows Update Interruption

Windows Update initiated the first planned restart at **02:44:42 Irish time**;
two planned servicing restarts followed, and the final operating-system start
was 02:49:14. Codex task execution did not resume until about 05:20. The exact
event-log sequence, installed updates, and pre-restart boundaries are recorded
in [`RESTART_INCIDENT_2026-07-15.md`](RESTART_INCIDENT_2026-07-15.md). No
interrupted or recovered work was converted into score movement.

Re-run `git status --short`, compare the published checkpoint with `HEAD`, and
refresh this section before every status report. Do not infer points from file
count, elapsed effort, or an agent's estimate.

## Open Certification Gates

The remaining 288 points are not a single implementation queue. They include
independent proof gates that must remain visible in status reports:

- semantic completion for remaining marketplace, federation, jobs, providers,
  side effects, feature/module gates, and consumer-visible error behavior;
- schema, migration, upgrade, and data-integrity evidence for remaining
  workflows;
- residual security, tenant-isolation, authorization, and localization depth;
- fixed-rubric assessment of the now-green complete build, full-suite, and
  exact-SHA CI evidence; the required push gate is satisfied at `dbafc5c3`, but
  the category remains banked at 45/100 until a scoring transaction accepts a
  movement;
- unchanged canonical React browser/runtime proof against ASP.NET;
- unchanged, Laravel-certified Web UK switched to ASP.NET by configuration only
  and rerun through the same workflow/accessibility suite;
- live-provider and operational proof, including Stripe/Connect plus unresolved
  refund, dispute, provider-event reconciliation, job, and integration behavior.

Stateful Web UK certification against Laravel must use a separately
provisioned disposable Laravel environment. The ordinary local Laravel database
is a confidential production-derived snapshot and is never a test fixture.

Before the local schema merge, discovery was 3,333 tests across 2,778 methods
and 391 classes. The earlier 48-shard moving-SHA investigation remained partial
at `df8c8b96`; its counts and failure are historical and must not be used as the
current denominator.

The post-pause allocator at `dbafc5c3` discovered and allocated 3,361 logical
tests exactly once across four whole-class shards (841, 840, 840, and 840).
GitHub run 29451087913 completed the required exact-SHA aggregate. Its downloaded
TRX files reported 841, 840, 840, and 864 executed runtime rows respectively,
or 3,385 total; all passed with 0 failed, skipped, error, timeout, or aborted.
Build, frozen-React Frontend, and Docker Build & Push also passed. This replaces
the absent-aggregate certification fact, but it does not automatically move any
of the 55 open build/test/CI points without a fixed-rubric scoring transaction.

## Finite Ordered Backend Queue

Complete these eight bounded packages in order unless an external dependency is
recorded against a package. Do not turn a package into estimated score movement;
points bank only through the evidence transaction above.

1. **Certify marketplace financial lifecycle with live providers.** The localized
   paid, payout, refund, escrow, reversal, and dispute workflows are implemented;
   obtain live Stripe/Connect proof without weakening their banked durable ledgers.
2. **Complete canonical React semantic contract evidence.** Resolve the 171
   method-unresolved entries, classify the 18 Laravel-missing/mismatched entries,
   and add payload, response, status, auth, tenant, upload, side-effect, and
   runtime evidence to the affected rows. The reconciled static matrix has no
   ASP.NET route/method gaps, so no route-count work may substitute for these
   semantic gates.
3. **Generate the unchanged Web UK-to-ASP.NET contract matrix.** Consume the
   current Web UK frontend ledger without frontend forks, classify every call
   against ASP.NET, and close configuration/auth/tenant/shape/status gaps before
   runtime switching.
4. **Close high-risk semantic workflows and providers.** Finish remaining
   federation, jobs,
   provider, side-effect, and feature-gate gaps with focused contract evidence.
5. **Close schema and upgrade deductions.** Reconcile remaining Laravel
   tables/constraints, prove both blank and upgrade migration paths, run model-
   drift gates, and record data-integrity/rollback or forward-remediation proof.
6. **Close security and localization deductions.** Finish tenant/authorization
   depth and the request/error/recipient-locale gaps listed in
   [`BACKEND_LOCALIZATION_CONTRACT.md`](BACKEND_LOCALIZATION_CONTRACT.md).
7. **Assess and bank complete build/test/CI evidence.** Review the exact
   `dbafc5c3` green aggregate against the fixed rubric, combine it with any
   still-required migration-specific proof, and record an explicit category
   movement or no-movement decision. Rerun only when the candidate changes;
   never substitute focused evidence for the recorded complete aggregate.
8. **Certify both unchanged clients.** Run the canonical React workflows and,
   after Web UK's Laravel-first certification, the same unchanged Web UK code
   against ASP.NET by configuration only, including accessibility and provider
   evidence required by the rubric.

## Required Status-Report Format

Every ASP.NET status report must present these five blocks in this order:

1. **Named baseline and SHA** - rubric version, Laravel SHA, last banked ASP.NET
   implementation SHA, scoring-record SHA, and currently inspected HEAD.
2. **Banked score** - one fixed-denominator total plus the seven category rows.
3. **Published but unscored** - exact commits and why points are not banked yet;
   write `none` when there are none.
4. **Dirty/in-flight work** - scoped files or workstream, verification achieved,
   and explicit confirmation that it contributes zero banked points.
5. **Certification gaps** - exact remaining deductions and the evidence needed
   to bank them.

Never report a blended ASP.NET/Web UK percentage, silently rescore history,
convert route counts into a completion percentage, or describe uncommitted work
as complete. Follow
[`DOCUMENTATION_GOVERNANCE.md`](DOCUMENTATION_GOVERNANCE.md) when updating this
status.
