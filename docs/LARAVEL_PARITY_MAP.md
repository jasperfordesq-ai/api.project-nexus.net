# Laravel Full-Parity Map

Last reviewed: 2026-07-14

Status: **Maintained reference — detailed evidence and gap map, not a current score**

Evidence provenance: the latest published-backend summary was reviewed on
2026-07-14 against Laravel
`903d03d3db78bbf87129ad35728be3b72819acaf` and ASP.NET implementation
`9875fb5dd33e3ab5c33ea77a83fcfb0b8c6c0b00`; dirty backend work is excluded.
Every older inventory lacking its own exact source pair is historical and
provenance-incomplete, regardless of words such as “latest” retained inside a
checkpoint.

Canonical source: `C:\platforms\htdocs\staging` (read-only).

This is the detailed evidence and gap map. Use
[`CURRENT_ASPNET_CONTRACT_STATUS.md`](CURRENT_ASPNET_CONTRACT_STATUS.md) for the
only current overall score, baseline SHAs, published/unscored split, and active
completion queue. Every inventory below is dated evidence and must be
regenerated before it is described as current.

## Latest Verified Backend Slice

Marketplace card settlement, Connect onboarding, paid-transition delivery, and
escrow settlement now
have durable provider boundaries. Destination-charge payments retain provider-bound
economics, while seller onboarding creates/reuses Express accounts, generates
tenant-correct links, polls all three completion capabilities, reconciles signed
replay-safe `account.updated` events, and emits one localized completion bell.
The first paid transition independently delivers localized buyer/seller email and
in-app bells, records per-channel idempotent delivery evidence, retries failed or
stale claims, and preserves payment state when a notification channel fails. Orders
now persist non-enumerable `MKT-{ULID}` identities. Migrations
`20260714105831_MarketplacePaymentSettlementParity` and
`20260714115746_MarketplaceConnectOnboardingParity`, plus
`20260714132232_MarketplacePaidNotificationParity` and
`20260714150317_MarketplaceEscrowSettlementParity`, apply on disposable upgraded
PostgreSQL with no pending model changes. The final focused payment/Connect/
notification/escrow proof passes 20/20. Escrow checkout now uses a separate
charge and durable hold; buyer delivery confirmation starts the dispute window;
an hourly job creates a source-charge-bound Connect transfer only after all
release gates pass and emits one localized seller payout bell. Refund execution,
provider-backed dispute resolution and webhook reconciliation, live-provider,
full-suite/CI, and unchanged-frontend runtime certification remain open.

Admin buyer dispute resolution now also executes full or partial provider
refunds. Destination charges request transfer and application-fee reversal;
paid separate-charge payouts reverse only the seller share under stable
idempotency. `20260714165402_MarketplaceRefundReconciliationParity` adds the
durable refund ledger and refund-aware economic constraints and applies cleanly
to disposable upgraded PostgreSQL. Signed external-refund/charge-dispute event
reconciliation, refund notifications, and live-provider proof remain open.

Signed `charge.refunded` events now bind provider charge/intent identity, require
destination-charge transfer and application-fee reversal evidence, reverse paid
separate-charge transfers idempotently, and enter each expanded provider refund
in the durable ledger once. Incomplete provider detail fails closed. Charge-
dispute win/loss reconciliation, refund notifications, and live-provider proof
remain open.

Signed charge-dispute events now freeze held escrow and restore it on a provider
win or convert a provider loss into the durable refund ledger. Paid/scheduled
payout disputes remain fail-closed until transfer reversal and reimbursement
evidence is implemented.

Paid separate-charge disputes now reverse and durably record the proportional
seller share, then reimburse that exact share on a provider win. Destination-
charge losses retrieve the charge transfer when needed and reverse it under a
stable key. Refund notification evidence and live-provider proof remain open.

The seven apparent document-era vetting gaps are retired OpenAPI-only artifacts:
Laravel live routes omit them, the controller prohibits them, feature tests assert
404/405, and canonical React uses the metadata-only replacement. The comparator now
conditionally retires them only while Laravel routes omit them; fixture and live proof
pass at **2,601/2,601 active operations matched, 0 missing**, with seven retired entries
reported separately. ASP.NET runtime proof matches the removal responses and preserves
both legacy and current vetting rows. Static route parity is closed. Live-
provider settlement, complete-suite/CI proof, unchanged-frontend runtime proof, schema/
localization depth, federation transport, and live-provider certification remain open.

## Historical Inventory Baseline

| Surface | Laravel Edition | .NET Edition |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Controllers | 309 | 225 |
| Services | 483 | 188 |
| Models/entities | 200 Laravel models | 191 EF entity files |
| Migrations | 377 | 131 static migration source files; 129 EF-discovered/applied runtime IDs |
| OpenAPI operations | 1,022 | 4,452 static controller operations from parity script |
| Schema tables | 455 Laravel source tables | 378 .NET static table names |
| Frontend routes | 589 React / 607 accessible in the historical comparator; the separate 2026-07-08 Web UK checkpoint reported 608 Laravel declarations | 462 legacy React routes; the 2026-07-08 Web UK checkpoint reported 612 local declarations, 608 matches, 0 missing, 2 extra exchange workflow routes, and 3 ignored infrastructure routes |
| Localization | 11 locales / 605 locale namespaces | 7 locales / 280 locale namespaces |
| Module guides | 24 curated Laravel module guides | maintained .NET parity docs recreated in this pass |
| Locales | 11 | 7 |

These counts are directional. They are not a parity score.

`scripts/compare-laravel-api-parity.ps1` generated
`artifacts/parity/api/api-parity.json` on 2026-07-13 after its fixture passed,
with 4,452 ASP.NET controller operations, 2,592 Laravel source operations after
supplemental API route parsing and de-duplication, 2,532 static matches, and 60
missing operations. All fourteen Event Offline Check-in shapes and all eight Event People workspace shapes are now owned with
focused proof passing 4/4. Group invite preview/accept and queued export
request/status/download now have canonical V2 owners; focused lifecycle proof
passed 3/3 and the combined group gate passed 6/6. The expanded remainder is
dominated by event-product routes and also includes the seven document-era
admin vetting writes plus
prerender reset/invalidate. Guardian-consent token lookup and grant now have
their distinct Laravel-compatible GET and POST owners.
Laravel `govuk-alpha*` accessible page
routes are excluded from the API comparator and tracked in the frontend
comparator. Regenerate the artifact before using the numbers for implementation
planning.

`scripts/compare-laravel-schema-parity.ps1` generated
`artifacts/parity/schema/schema-parity.json` on 2026-07-13 after its fixture
passed. The current live table baseline is 377 Laravel migrations, 131 ASP.NET
migration source files, 129 runtime IDs, 455 Laravel source tables, 378 .NET
table names, 187 exact matches, 268 missing Laravel-side names, and 191 .NET-
only names. The artifact is ignored by git; regenerate it before using the
numbers for schema implementation planning.

`scripts/compare-laravel-frontend-parity.ps1` generated
`artifacts/parity/frontend/frontend-parity.json` on 2026-07-04 with 589 Laravel
React routes, 462 .NET React routes, 393 React matches, 196 missing Laravel-side
React routes, 607 Laravel accessible routes, 136 `apps/web-uk` routes, 53
accessible matches, and 554 missing Laravel-side accessible routes. The artifact
is ignored by git. The React side of this artifact is now historical inventory
for the retired `apps/react-frontend` fork. Do not use it to plan new React work
in this repo unless explicitly approved. Use the production Laravel React
frontend at `C:\platforms\htdocs\staging\react-frontend` as the contract target
for ASP.NET backend compatibility.

For current `apps/web-uk` accessible frontend work, read
`apps/web-uk/docs/CURRENT_LARAVEL_FIRST_PARITY_STATUS.md` and then its generated
matrix. At the historical 2026-07-08 merge commit `f7c80d32`, that matrix reported 608/608 Laravel accessible routes
matched, 0 missing, 2 extra local exchange workflow routes, and 3 ignored
infrastructure routes.

`scripts/compare-laravel-localization-parity.ps1` generated
`artifacts/parity/localization/localization-parity.json` on 2026-07-04 with 11
Laravel locales, 7 .NET locales, 605 Laravel locale namespaces, 280 .NET locale
namespaces, 49 namespace matches, and an English key scan showing 17,280 Laravel
keys, 5,575 .NET keys, 157 matched keys, and 4,942 missing Laravel-side keys in
matched namespaces. The artifact is ignored by git; regenerate it before using
the numbers for localization implementation planning.

`scripts/export-laravel-parity-backlog.ps1` generated
`artifacts/parity/backlog/parity-backlog.json` on 2026-07-05 with 6,487 open
implementation items across API, schema, frontend, and localization artifacts.
The artifact is ignored by git; `docs/PARITY_BACKLOG.md` is the curated rollup.

## Source Evidence For Former Exclusions

> **2026-07-10 admin/auth correction:** The broad `Admin users` row below is
> historical where it describes scheduled runs as observability-only or lists
> tenant/global privilege columns and God-only semantics as absent. Commit
> `d2132a50` adds dedicated privilege columns, DB-backed policy rehydration,
> explicit `GodOnly`, protected God targets, real execution for
> `listing-expiry` and `job-expiry`; the guardian follow-up also maps
> `volunteer-expire-consents`, and recurring-shift parity maps
> `recurring-shifts`, leaving explicit disabled/501 behavior for the other 38
> cron definitions. Route-owner collisions are covered by live
> endpoint-table tests. Remaining gaps are full application-runtime
> certification, resource-level SuperPanel/hub authorization, user-move
> orchestration, notifications/audits, process-local auth challenges, and the
> 38 unmapped cron workflows.

> **2026-07-12 volunteer-hours checkpoint:** One canonical
> `VolunteerHoursService` now owns all eight Laravel member, organisation, and
> administrator hours routes, plus Caring support relationship hour logging.
> Locked tenant-scoped `vol_logs` decisions create semantically linked personal,
> organisation, and XP evidence exactly once; sub-hour approvals award XP
> without zero-value ledger rows. Direct Caring logging preserves the raw
> fractional input for whole-hour flooring and regional-points calculation before
> storing rounded hours. Migration `20260711192124_VolunteerHoursLedgerParity` is
> runtime ID 111 and never inserts legacy transaction/payment/XP value;
> evidence-free approved whole-hour organisation rows become `pending`, while
> approved Caring sub-hour rows remain valid. Its source also defines the tenant-
> scoped `feed_activity` projection and public-hours preference. Approved
> hours publish idempotently as `volunteer_hours` only when the volunteer has not
> opted out, with no description copied into feed content or metadata. Other
> producers, admin moderation integration, cleanup, and backfill remain open.
> Debug API/test builds and the required solution-wide Release build complete
> with zero errors and only the same four pre-existing `xUnit1031` warnings; the
> Release build took 4m36s. One disposable Linux run discovered 3,007 tests
> and passed 53/53: all 51 `VolunteerHoursParityTests` plus both
> `V15FeedActivityCompatibilityTests`. Final migration certification is also
> green: blank ID-111 replay with exact feed/privacy/FK assertions, valid
> populated 110-to-111 behavior, invalid `P0001` atomic abort with no partial
> DDL, and `has-pending-model-changes`. Disposable Docker cleanup left zero
> matching resources. The clean affected rerun discovered 3,007 tests, selected
> 243, and passed 243/243 with zero failed/skipped in 418.639s. The full 3,007-
> test suite, CI, and unchanged-frontend proof remain open.

> **2026-07-12 safeguarding/messaging checkpoint:** The runtime chain now ends
> at ID 115, `20260712060051_DirectMessageStateParity`.
> Migration 112 creates the five exact metadata-only Laravel safeguarding
> tables; migration 113 adds the `messaging_disabled` monitoring adapter; and
> migration 114 installs required consent time, a unique tenant/user/option
> selection, wider selected values, and tenant/option cascades. Migration 115
> adds durable edit/delete/archive state, false/null defaults, and a nullable
> deletion-audit user relationship with `SET NULL`. Blank 115 and populated
> 114-to-115 replays are green and preserve message content/read timestamps;
> migration 114's invalid duplicate `P0001`/no-partial-schema and catalog-
> containment proof remains retained. Model drift is green, migration 115 is
> forward-only, legacy vetting evidence does not authorize contact, and no
> frontend source was changed.
>
> Onboarding, member, admin/broker vetting, policy rotation, and protected
> option CRUD/reorder now use the locked metadata-only policy domain with exact
> risk-specific rate limits. Live message restrictions, hardened direct send,
> transactional detected-audio voice send, and the Laravel group-exchange
> caller/role/lifecycle/ledger cutover are implemented with focused contracts.
> Provider transcription, notification depth, and unchanged-frontend smoke
> remain open. P0 sender-only 24-hour edit, participant-scoped durable delete,
> and partner-ID per-user archive/restore are implemented. P1 durable reactions,
> full typing preflight/Pusher delivery, coordinator-help delivery/dedupe/audit,
> and exact read/unread envelopes/rates remain. The final deterministic direct-
> message state gate passed 39/39 with zero failed or skipped. The broader exact regression completed
> 57/58 with its sole existing race green in isolation; a separate class
> aggregate completed 12/13 before disposable PostgreSQL OOM `exit 137`, with
> the race also green in isolation. Neither aggregate is fully green, and this

| Area | Laravel evidence | .NET evidence | Current gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Safeguarding metadata and policy | Laravel metadata-only attestation/jurisdiction/policy services, onboarding/member/admin controllers, safeguarding option workflows, and canonical React onboarding/messages consumers | `AdminSafeguardingVettingController`, `SafeguardingVettingMemberController`, `OnboardingSafeguardingController`, `AdminSafeguardingController`, the locked safeguarding services, five exact tables in migration 112, messaging adapter migration 113, preference dependency migration 114, and focused schema/domain/access/controller/rate/replay tests | Dedicated custom permission roles beyond current broker/admin authorization, queued email/provider fidelity, controlled legacy evidence disposition, non-v2 alias reconciliation, frontend runtime smoke, full suite, and CI remain open. |
| Direct messaging safety | Laravel `MessagesController`, `MessageService`, audio uploader, safeguarding interaction policy, canonical React `MessagesPage`/`ConversationPage` | Live restriction lifecycle; hardened text send/thread/attachments/side effects; POST-only staff blocked-attempt alerting; corrected partner/attachment projection; transactional detected-audio voice send; migration-115 durable state; sender-only 24-hour edit; participant-safe `self|everyone` delete; and partner-ID per-user archive/restore with active/archived inbox and unread filtering | P1 real reaction storage/batch/policy, typing preflight plus Pusher event, coordinator-help restricted-only delivery/dedupe/audit, and exact read/unread envelopes/rates remain. Provider transcription remains open. The final deterministic focused gate is 39/39 with zero failed/skipped, but the earlier 57/58 and 12/13 aggregates were not fully green for the qualified race/OOM reasons above. |
| Group exchange policy/ledger | Laravel group exchange controller/service and canonical React group-exchange pages | `GroupExchangeController`, `GroupExchangeService`, and focused lifecycle/policy/conservation/race tests now enforce caller/role identity, create/add authorization order, deterministic locking, caller-order policy evaluation, lifecycle state, canonical provider transaction rows, and hidden ledger adapters | Notification fidelity and frontend runtime smoke remain; legacy one-to-one `Exchange` is a separate fail-closed workflow. |
| Volunteer hours ledger | Laravel volunteering hours member, organisation, and administrator controllers/services; Caring support relationship hour logging; canonical React hours consumers | `VolunteerHoursController`, `VolunteerHoursService`, `VolunteerHoursLedgerParity`, and focused hours/badge/email/regional-points tests; the eight Laravel method/path pairs share strict request/action parsing, tenant/feature/policy gates, separate rate buckets, locked approval/decline transitions, exact-once whole-hour personal and organisation settlement, volunteer-hour XP/badge evidence, normal non-Caring reviewed-decision bell/push, forced-immediate approved-decision email, immediate declined-decision email only for an explicit global `instant` frequency, represented-family post-approval badge sweep, explicit no-decision-notification behavior for reviewed Caring, sub-hour no-ledger behavior, raw fractional Caring semantics, and regional-points convergence | Current focused proof is one 53/53 disposable-Linux run: all 51 `VolunteerHoursParityTests` and both `V15FeedActivityCompatibilityTests`, with 3,007 tests discovered. Debug API/test builds and the solution-wide Release build have zero errors and only the same four pre-existing `xUnit1031` warnings; the Release build took 4m36s. Final blank/populated/invalid migration-111 replay and `has-pending-model-changes` gates are green, with zero disposable Docker resources left. The clean affected rerun selected and passed 243/243 with zero failed/skipped in 418.639s. The full 3,007-test suite, CI, exact permission-table fidelity, tenant-default notification-frequency fallback, daily/monthly notification-queue delivery, recipient locale/provider breadth, Laravel-only badge families, realtime badge broadcast, and unchanged-frontend runtime certification remain open; this is not a 1000/1000 claim. |
| Admin users | `AdminUsersController.php`, `AdminSuperController.php`, Laravel React `admin/api/adminApi.ts`, `admin/modules/users/UserList.tsx`, super-admin user pages/tests | `AdminController.cs`, `AdminCompatibilityController.cs`, `AdminCompatibility3Controller.cs`, `AdminExplicitParityController.cs`, `NexusUserAccessAuthorization.cs`, `CanonicalRoleSemantics`, and focused role/writer/hidden-route tests | V2 list/detail/create/update/import, single/bulk actions, badges, consents, password helpers, impersonation, and tenant/global privilege toggles expose Laravel React envelopes with tenant scoping. Dedicated `is_admin`, `is_super_admin`, `is_tenant_super_admin`, and `is_god` columns now back DB-rehydrated policies; role-only `god` cannot cross `GodOnly`, explicit-God targets are protected, and stale role/tenant tokens fail. Manual cron execution now runs `ListingExpiry`, `JobVacancyExpiry`, `VolunteerGuardianConsentExpiry`, or `VolunteerRecurringShiftGeneration`, while the other 38 definitions are disabled/501 rather than fabricated successes. Remaining gaps include resource-level SuperPanel/hub rules, related-table user movement, notifications/audits, provider-backed email side effects, distributed scheduler locking, and the wider catch-all/scheduled workflow backlog. |
| Admin matching configuration | `AdminMatchingController::getConfig/updateConfig/clearCache`, `SmartMatchingEngine::getConfig`, Laravel React `react-frontend/src/admin/api/adminApi.ts`, `react-frontend/src/admin/modules/matching/MatchingConfig.tsx` | `AdminCompatibilityController.GetMatchingConfig/UpdateMatchingConfig`, `LaravelReactFrontendContractTests.AdminMatchingConfigV2_*`; `/api/v2/admin/matching/config` now returns Laravel's `data` envelope with React `SmartMatchingConfig` fields, five proximity bands, gates, engine version, pillars, adjustments, and AI flags; `PUT /api/v2/admin/matching/config` persists Laravel React partial updates into tenant-scoped matching config and reads them back in the Laravel response shape while preserving legacy `/api/admin/matching/config` behavior | SmartMatchingEngine score parity, `match_cache` table deletion semantics for clear-cache, analytics fidelity, broker approval workflow parity, provider/AI availability fidelity, and runtime frontend smoke coverage remain gaps |
| Admin analytics / impact reporting | `AdminCommunityAnalyticsController.php`, `AdminImpactReportController.php`, Laravel React `admin/modules/analytics/CommunityAnalytics.tsx`, `admin/modules/impact/ImpactReport.tsx` | `AdminCompatibilityController.cs`, `LaravelReactFrontendContractTests`, `AdminCompatibilityControllerTests`; community analytics dashboard/geography/export routes already have Laravel React coverage, and impact-report GET/config PUT now return Laravel React `data.sroi/health/timeline/config` and `data.message` envelopes | Deeper Laravel service equivalence, social-value cross-report sync, CSV/runtime frontend smoke coverage, and exact SROI formula parity remain gaps |
| Admin CMS pages | `AdminContentController::getPages/getPage/createPage/updatePage/deletePage`, Laravel React `adminApi.ts` `adminPages.*` | `AdminPagesController.cs`, `LaravelReactFrontendContractTests`; `/api/v2/admin/pages` list/detail/create/update/delete now accepts Laravel React `status`, numeric `show_in_menu`, `content_format`, `design_json`, `menu_order`, returns React-compatible `data` rows, and stores Laravel-only metadata in tenant config alongside the .NET `Page` entity | Builder rendering fidelity, exact Laravel `pages` schema columns, menu-item cleanup/side effects, cache invalidation, and runtime frontend smoke coverage remain gaps |
| Admin blog CRUD and bulk actions | `AdminBlogController::index/show/store/update/destroy/toggleStatus/bulkDelete/bulkPublish`, `BlogPublicController::index/categories/show`, Laravel React `adminBlog.*`, `BlogPage.tsx`, `BlogPostPage.tsx`, `POST /api/v2/admin/blog/bulk-delete`, `POST /api/v2/admin/blog/bulk-publish` | `AdminBlogController.cs`, `AdminExplicitParityController.cs`, `BlogV2Controller.cs`, `AdminBlogControllerTests`, `BlogControllerTests`; anonymous `/api/v2/blog`, `/api/v2/blog/categories`, and `/api/v2/blog/{slug}` now return Laravel React `success/data/meta` envelopes with cursor pagination, `per_page/has_more/cursor`, title/excerpt search, `featured_image`, author/category rows, post counts, SEO fields, and detail content while preserving legacy `/api/blog` auth behavior. `/api/v2/admin/blog` list matches Laravel React pagination defaults, `current_page/per_page/total/total_pages/has_more` meta, content/title search, ignored invalid status filters, and flattened `author_name`/`category_name` rows. Create/show/update/delete/toggle-status accepts React `slug`, `status`, `featured_image`, `meta_title`, `meta_description`, and `noindex` payload fields, returns Laravel `success/data` blog-post envelopes, and stores Laravel-only `noindex` in tenant config. `/api/v2/admin/blog/bulk-delete` and `/api/v2/admin/blog/bulk-publish` accept React `post_ids`, tenant-scope existing `BlogPost` rows, return Laravel `success/data.success/failed/skipped_ids`, delete eligible rows, and publish draft rows while skipping already-published/missing ids | Exact Laravel `posts`/`seo_metadata` schema fidelity, Laravel activity/audit side effects, blog comments/reactions, resource workflows, and runtime frontend smoke coverage remain gaps |
| Public resources | `ResourcePublicController::index/categories/store/download`, `ResourceCategoryController::tree`, Laravel React `ResourcesPage.tsx` | `ResourcesV2Controller.cs`, `FileUpload`, `TenantConfig`, `ResourcesControllerTests`; anonymous tenant-scoped `/api/v2/resources` now returns Laravel React `success/data/meta` cursor envelopes with `per_page`, `has_more`, `cursor`, `base_url`, search/category filters, `file_url`, `file_path`, `file_type`, `file_size`, `downloads`, uploader rows, category color rows, default social counters, and Laravel's `sort_order` plus newest-first ordering. Anonymous `/api/v2/resources/categories` returns category `id/name/slug/color/resource_count`; `/api/v2/resources/categories/tree` is explicitly routed. Authenticated multipart `POST /api/v2/resources` now accepts React `title`/`description`/`category_id`/`file`, enforces Laravel's resource upload extension/content-type allowlist, rejects SVG before storage with `errors[].code=FILE_TYPE_NOT_ALLOWED`, stores accepted bytes on disk, persists resource-linked `FileUpload` metadata, returns MIME `file_type`, byte `file_size`, stored `file_path`, and `file_url`, and list reads preserve that metadata. Authenticated `/api/v2/resources/{id}/download` streams stored upload bytes and increments a tenant-scoped compatibility download counter that list reads expose, with focused runtime coverage. Legacy `/api/resources` remains auth-protected. | Exact Laravel `resources.file_path/file_type/file_size/downloads/content_*` column fidelity, localized validation text, persisted category color/slug storage, update/delete error-message parity, resource likes/comments integration, and browser smoke coverage remain gaps |
| Admin feed moderation and announcer role | `AdminFeedController::index/show/hide/destroy/stats/grantAnnouncer/revokeAnnouncer`, Laravel React `adminModeration.*` feed calls and `UserEdit.tsx` announcer toggle | `AdminFeedController.cs`, `AdminExplicitParityController.cs`, `AdminController.cs`, `LaravelReactFrontendContractTests`; `/api/v2/admin/feed/posts`, `/posts/{id}`, `/posts/{id}/hide`, `/posts/{id}?type=...`, and `/stats` now return Laravel React `success/data/meta` envelopes, snake_case rows, counts, hidden/flagged state, detail rows, and success action bodies for post-backed, listing-backed, event-backed, poll-backed, goal-backed, job-backed, challenge-backed, volunteer-backed, blog-backed, and discussion-backed feed moderation while preserving legacy `/api/admin/feed` behavior. Feed moderation now uses the Laravel-aligned `BrokerOrAdmin` policy for admin-tier, broker, and coordinator callers while preserving member denial and admin-only announcer grant/revoke behavior; post-backed, authored non-post, and compatibility-authored challenge hide/delete now deny broker/coordinator self-moderation with a Laravel-style 403 while admin-tier callers retain access. The canonical `FeedActivity` entity/configuration/service and migration definition for `feed_activity` now exist at source level, but non-post hide/delete visibility and challenge feed authors still use tenant config; those admin consumers and producers have not migrated to the canonical projection; Laravel React `POST /api/v2/ideation-challenges` now creates persisted challenges and writes challenge feed authors, `GET/PUT /api/v2/ideation-challenges/{id}` now return/persist Laravel React edit-form metadata, and `DELETE /api/v2/ideation-challenges/{id}` now returns Laravel's HTTP 204 while removing the challenge/feed compatibility state. `grant-announcer`/`revoke-announcer` now return Laravel React success envelopes and update admin user-detail `roles[]` with `municipality_announcer` for the user-edit screen | migration of admin moderation and remaining producers to canonical `feed_activity`, cleanup/backfill fidelity, Laravel `roles`/`user_roles` schema fidelity, notification/audit/email side effects, and runtime frontend smoke coverage remain gaps |
| Feed tracking | `SocialController::recordImpression/recordClick/recordImpressionV2/recordClickV2`, `FeedRankingService::recordImpression/recordClick`, Laravel React `useFeedTracking.ts`, `useFeedImpression.ts` | `V15SocialCompatibilityController.TrackFeedEvent`, `LaravelReactFrontendContractTests`; `/api/v2/feed/posts/{id}/impression`, `/api/v2/feed/posts/{id}/click`, `/api/v2/feed/impression`, and `/api/v2/feed/click` now return Laravel v2 `data.recorded` envelopes, validate React `target_type`/`target_id`, tenant-scope feed target existence, and return Laravel-style `errors[]` for validation/not-found failures. Focused Debug runtime smoke coverage passes for post impression, polymorphic post impression, listing click, and invalid target type | Native .NET still lacks Laravel `feed_impressions`/`feed_clicks` storage, per-user debounce, CTR aggregation, and FeedRankingService side effects; runtime frontend browser smoke coverage remains a gap |
| Feed hide / not interested | `SocialController::hidePostV2/notInterested`, Laravel React feed/detail hide controls, Laravel `feed_hidden` table | `V15SocialCompatibilityController.HidePost/NotInterested`, `HiddenPost`, `TenantConfig`, `V15SocialCompatibilityControllerUnitTests`; `/api/v2/feed/posts/{id}/hide` and `/api/v2/feed/posts/{id}/not-interested` now accept Laravel React route id plus optional `type`, validate tenant-scoped feed targets, write post hides to `HiddenPost`, write non-post hidden state to deterministic tenant-config rows, and return Laravel-compatible `success/data` envelopes. Focused controller-level runtime coverage passes for listing hide and not-interested | Native .NET still lacks Laravel `feed_hidden` table/schema parity and EdgeRank/feed-ranking side effects; browser smoke coverage remains a gap |
| Feed post delete | `SocialController::deletePostV2`, Laravel React feed/profile/group/detail delete controls | `V15SocialCompatibilityController.DeletePost`, `FeedPost`, `V15SocialCompatibilityControllerUnitTests`; `DELETE /api/v2/feed/posts/{id}` and `POST /api/v2/feed/posts/{id}/delete` now tenant-scope post lookup, enforce owner-only deletion, return Laravel-style 404/403 `errors[]`, delete the post, and return `success/data.deleted/id`. Focused controller-level runtime coverage passes for success and forbidden paths | canonical `feed_activity` row cleanup and historical backfill side effects, notification/audit side effects, and browser smoke coverage remain gaps |
| Feed user mute | `SocialController::muteUserV2`, Laravel React feed/profile/group/detail mute controls, Laravel `feed_muted_users` table | `V15SocialCompatibilityController.MuteUserV2/MuteUser`, `MutedUser`, `V15SocialCompatibilityControllerUnitTests`; `/api/v2/feed/users/{id}/mute` now tenant-scopes target-user lookup, rejects self/invalid mutes, idempotently stores `MutedUser`, and returns Laravel-compatible `success/data.muted/user_id`; legacy `/api/feed/mute` keeps the body alias | Exact Laravel `feed_muted_users` table/schema naming, broader missing-user/browser smoke coverage, and feed-ranking side effects remain gaps |

| Non-Stripe ID providers | `VeriffProvider.php`, `OnfidoProvider.php`, `JumioProvider.php`, `IdenfyProvider.php`, `RegistrationPolicyController::listProviders`, `TenantProviderCredentialService.php` | `NonStripeIdentityProviders.cs` adds Veriff, Onfido, Jumio, and iDenfy adapters; `ReactFrontendCompatibilityController` now returns Laravel-style admin provider list/policy payloads and saves encrypted tenant provider credentials in `tenant_provider_credentials` | Live/sandbox HTTP contract, provider-specific webhook end-to-end verification, and full admin workflow parity still need verification |
| Tenant SSO providers | `AdminSsoProvidersController.php`, `SsoOidcService.php`, `tenant_sso_providers` migration | `AdminSsoProvidersController.cs`, `TenantSsoProviderService.cs`, `TenantSsoProvider.cs`, `tenant_sso_providers` migration | Admin provider CRUD/test surface now matched; public SSO redirect/callback, PKCE state, token validation, domain guard, and account-linking flow still need full parity |
| Mailchimp-like behavior | `MailchimpService.php` | no matched provider files; email templates exist | Decide equivalent behavior and implement or document replacement |
| Partner API / portal | `app/Http/Controllers/Api/PartnerApi`, `app/Services/PartnerApi`, `react-frontend/src/partners` | API partner admin entity/service/controller | External partner API/auth/webhook parity incomplete |
| Accessible frontend | `accessible-frontend/`, `routes/govuk-alpha.php`, `routes/govuk-alpha-parity/*`, and Laravel backend contracts used by those workflows | `apps/web-uk/` is the shared accessible frontend implementation target; Laravel Blade defines the product/UI behaviour and the Laravel backend defines the API contract; ASP.NET is not authoritative and belongs to a separate compatibility workstream | Advanced implementation with route/workflow/manual-certification gaps; static coverage does not certify production readiness or unchanged ASP.NET switching |

## Backlog Order

1. **Contract inventory and tooling**
   - Generate a .NET OpenAPI snapshot from the running API.
   - Normalize Laravel `/api/v2` paths against .NET `/api` and compatibility
     prefixes.
   - Build explicit schema alias mapping for renamed tables, especially
     Laravel `vol_*` tables versus .NET `volunteer_*` names.
   - Build route alias mapping for frontend redirects and intentionally renamed
     accessible paths.
   - Build namespace alias mapping for Laravel backend/email/accessible
     translation namespaces versus React and future .NET backend targets.
   - Use `scripts/export-laravel-parity-backlog.ps1` after every artifact refresh
     so missing API/schema/frontend/localization rows remain ordered and
     acceptance-criteria backed.
   - Acceptance: `docs/API_PARITY.md` can list matched, missing, extra, and
     intentionally-renamed endpoints from generated artifacts, and
     `docs/SCHEMA_PARITY.md` can distinguish exact matches, accepted aliases,
     missing tables, and extra .NET tables. `docs/FRONTEND_PARITY.md` can
     distinguish React route gaps from accessible HTML route gaps, and
     `docs/LOCALIZATION_PARITY.md` can distinguish missing locales, namespaces,
     and keys.

2. **User-facing API gaps**
   - Prioritize endpoints used by Laravel React frontend pages and accessible
     frontend routes.
   - Acceptance: route, method, `/api/v2` alias, auth, tenant scoping, request
     validation, response shape, error shape, upload behavior, realtime config,
     and status codes match the Laravel React frontend contract or have
     documented .NET-compatible aliases.

3. **Caring Community and National KISS**
   - Port domain entities, services, admin routes, member routes, scheduled
     tasks, locale keys, and backend contracts needed by the canonical Laravel
     React frontend.
   - Acceptance: Laravel caring/KISS tests or equivalent .NET integration tests
     cover workflows, tenant isolation, admin authorization, and Laravel React
     request/response compatibility.

4. **Marketplace / commerce / monetization**
   - Complete marketplace listing, order, payment, escrow, pickup, coupon,
     remaining merchant onboarding, local advertising, and promotion workflows.
   - Current evidence: Laravel React merchant-onboarding wizard status,
     step-1/2/3, and complete calls now have ASP.NET contract coverage.
     Buyer shipping selector options and seller shipping-options CRUD now return
     React-compatible fields.
     Promotion selector products and promote-submit calls now use React
     `promotion_type` and Laravel-style success/data envelopes. Marketplace
     offer-create calls now accept the React `amount`/`currency`/`message`
     payload and return Laravel snake_case offer fields in a success envelope.
     MyOffers sent/received reads and counter/accept-counter/withdraw actions
     now return React-compatible success envelopes, cursor metadata, nested
     listing/counterparty fields, and Laravel action statuses. Direct
     accept/decline now uses Laravel seller-only authorization, accepted-offer
     listing reservation, and competing-offer decline side effects. Seller
     pickup-slot create/list/delete now accepts React `slot_start`/`slot_end`
     payloads and returns Laravel slot field names with persisted recurrence
     and booked-count state. Seller coupon CRUD now accepts the React coupon
     form payload and returns formatted `data.items`/coupon/delete envelopes.
     BuyNow coupon validation, direct order creation, and local payment-intent
     calls now accept the React payloads and return Laravel-style envelopes.
     Seller profile avatar/cover multipart uploads now return React-compatible
     `data.url` payloads on `/api/v2/marketplace/seller/profile`.
     Category reads now return Laravel React category rows with
     `listing_count` for active approved listings.
     Category template reads now return the Laravel empty-template
     `success/data` envelope with `category_id`, `name: null`, and `fields: []`
     for the create/edit/category React pages.
     Admin marketplace dashboard and moderation listing reads now return the
     Laravel React stats, pagination metadata, `per_page` support, and
     formatted listing rows instead of raw EF entities.
     Admin moderation approve/reject/delete actions now return Laravel React
     success message envelopes and use Laravel-style removed/rejected state
     transitions instead of hard deletes or raw entity payloads.
     Admin marketplace bulk reject now accepts the React `listing_ids`/`reason`
     payload and returns the shared bulk action `success`/`failed`/`skipped_ids`
     result while leaving out-of-tenant or missing ids untouched.
     Admin seller management now returns Laravel React seller rows for
     `MarketplaceSellerAdmin.tsx`, accepts `per_page`/`seller_type`/`verified`
     filters plus the React search query, and returns success message envelopes
     for business verification and empty-body seller suspension.
     Admin coupon oversight now returns Laravel React `data.items` rows and
     success envelopes for suspend/delete actions.
     Marketplace map-search nearby listing calls now support React `lat`/`lng`,
     `radius_km`, `q`, `category_id`, `limit`, and return `distance_km`.
     Seller Stripe onboarding status/start calls now return the React
     `stripe_onboarding_complete` status shape and empty-body start response
     with both `onboarding_url` and `url` aliases, while real Stripe Connect
     provider orchestration remains a payment-provider gap.
     Listing create/edit media upload accepts Laravel React snake_case listing
     payloads and multipart `images[]`/`video` uploads. Pickup reservation,
     buyer my-pickups, and seller QR scan calls now return Laravel reservation
     field names and picked-up status transitions.
     Community delivery offer create/list/accept/confirm
     calls now use React payloads and Laravel response field names/statuses.
     Donation checkout payment-intent and receipt calls now return the React-compatible `client_secret`,
     `donation_id`, and receipt JSON envelopes.
   - Acceptance: member/admin APIs and React/admin pages match Laravel
     workflows, with payment-provider safety tests.

5. **Verein / Clubs and Regional Analytics**
   - Replace remaining compatibility shells with real domain models, services,
     reports, dues/federation workflows, billing/export, and scheduled jobs.
   - Acceptance: integration tests cover dues, federation consent, analytics
     reports, billing/export, and tenant isolation.

6. **Identity provider parity**
   - Verify Veriff, Onfido, Jumio, and Idenfy adapters against live or sandbox
     HTTP contracts and tenant-level provider configuration.
   - Extend the React admin workflow tests beyond controller-level contracts,
     including browser/API round trips for credential save/delete and
     registration-policy writes.
   - Acceptance: provider config persistence, webhook signature validation,
     sanitized audit events, fallback behavior, and admin settings are tested end
     to end against provider sandbox contracts.

7. **Partner API and accessible frontend**
   - Complete external partner API auth, rate limiting, webhooks, and portal
     workflows.
   - Map `apps/web-uk/` against Laravel `accessible-frontend/` route by route.
   - Keep `apps/web-uk/` visually aligned to Laravel Blade accessible while
     preserving Express/Nunjucks/GOV.UK Frontend as the preferred future stack.
   - Acceptance: accessible route tests cover tenant, auth, feature gates, and
     core workflows.

8. **Localization, docs, and operational readiness**
   - Close locale count/key gaps and update all docs after each module batch.
   - Acceptance: docs maps reflect source state; test commands pass or failures
     are documented with owners.

## Acceptance Criteria For 100% Parity

- Every Laravel OpenAPI operation and route-file endpoint is matched,
  intentionally renamed with compatibility behavior, or documented as replaced
  by an equivalent .NET workflow.
- Every Laravel module guide has a corresponding .NET implementation note and
  test plan.
- React admin/member workflows from the canonical Laravel React frontend have
  equivalent ASP.NET API support proven by route/API matrix rows, regression
  tests, and runtime smoke tests.
- The legacy `apps/react-frontend/` copy remains frozen unless the user
  explicitly approves frontend work.
- Formerly excluded modules have real implementations or explicitly approved product
  decisions outside this technical parity goal.
- `dotnet test Nexus.sln --configuration Release` and relevant frontend checks
  pass for the implemented surfaces.
